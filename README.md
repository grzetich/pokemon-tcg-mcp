# Pokémon TCG MCP Server
This repository contains a lightweight Model Context Protocol (MCP) server built with Flask and the pokemon-tcgsdk-python library. It exposes the full functionality of the Pokémon TCG API (pokemontcg.io) as a set of accessible HTTP endpoints, designed to be easily consumed by LLM (Large Language Model) clients, custom applications, or other services requiring Pokémon TCG data.FeaturesComprehensive Card Data: Retrieve detailed information for individual Pokémon cards or search for cards based on various criteria (name, set, type, rarity).Real-time Pricing: Fetch current TCGPlayer market prices for specific cards.Set Information: Access details about Pokémon TCG sets.Categorical Data: Query lists of all available card types, supertypes, subtypes, and rarities.Pagination: Supports pagination for list endpoints (/cards, /sets) to manage large datasets.RESTful API: Standard HTTP methods (GET) and JSON responses.Production-Ready Deployment: Configured for easy deployment to Heroku using Gunicorn.Getting StartedThese instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing.PrerequisitesBefore you begin, ensure you have the following installed:Python 3.xpip (Python package installer)InstallationClone the repository:git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-pokemon-mcp-server.git
cd your-pokemon-mcp-server
(Remember to replace your-username/your-pokemon-mcp-server with your actual repository URL)Install dependencies:It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment.python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
pip install -r requirements.txt
Obtain a Pokémon TCG API Key (Recommended):While the pokemontcg.io API allows some usage without a key, you will experience significantly higher rate limits by registering for a free API key at pokemontcg.io Developer Portal.API Key ConfigurationFor security and best practice, the server reads the API key from an environment variable.Local Development:Set the POKEMONTCG_API_KEY environment variable in your terminal session:export POKEMONTCG_API_KEY="YOUR_ACTUAL_API_KEY_GOES_HERE"
Replace YOUR_ACTUAL_API_KEY_GOES_HERE with your key. This is temporary for the current session.Heroku Deployment:Configure a "Config Var" named POKEMONTCG_API_KEY with your actual API key value in your Heroku app settings.Running LocallyAfter installing dependencies and setting your API key:python app.py
The server will typically run on http://127.0.0.1:5000/.Deployment to HerokuThis project is configured for straightforward deployment to Heroku. Ensure you have the Heroku CLI installed.Log in to Heroku CLI:heroku login
Create a Heroku app:heroku create your-unique-app-name
Set the API Key as a Config Var:heroku config:set POKEMONTCG_API_KEY="YOUR_ACTUAL_API_KEY_GOES_HERE" -a your-unique-app-name
Push your code to Heroku:git push heroku main
Open the deployed app:heroku open
